# Rainfall and Flood Prediction

Flood and heavy Rainfall is the most common and dangerous natural disaster in India and all over the world. India has suffered deeply because of the rainfall or flood. As we know, climate directly affects humans and wildlife. In India, the most important factor for survival is Agriculture. Not only rural but urban areas are also affected badly, livelihood, savings, and all struggles vanish in one go. It all happens because prediction of heavy rainfall or flood is not done, which is a big problem. Predicting the amount of rainfall gives alertness to farmers by knowing early so that they can protect their crops and properties from rain. Not only farmers but we can alert people working in coastal areas like fishermen. We can alert them as well. Childrenâ€™s and people working can also be alerted so that they can know the real-time condition of their area. To help society and resolve the problem we are using the ML algorithms of them are ANN, CART, Genetic Algorithms and SVN.
